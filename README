This package can be used to install orcv, chunknet, largescaleobjects, and largescaler.
Each of these packages also have a repository on Rforge and GitHub, and it is worth checking each one individually, with their package-specific demos.

github.com/jcai849/orcv
github.com/jcai849/chunknet
github.com/jcai849/largescaleobjects
github.com/jcai849/largescalemodels

Or, just use this as a flake. Install nix, then run:

nix shell
largescaler run --type=sandbox local --node-count=30
